# Soft-ata

## In Brief
**An Arduino app _LIKE_ Firmata for RPI Pico W running Arduino.**
Includes a .NET package so that you can write your own client in C#. 
Console app included with Blazor and MAUI apps coming soon.
  
_Soft-ata rather than firm-ata!_

## Background
I wanted to use a RPI Pico W with Arduino installed controlled by .NET apps. Drilling deeper, 
I wanted to make the Pico coding available to my grandkids with a Blockly style UI as per 
[CodeCraft](https://ide.tinkergen.com/). There is also [BlocklyDuino](https://blocklyduino.github.io/BlocklyDuino/). 

After some consideration I had a back-to-the-future moment. What about Firmata? Alas ...


## Firmata

> Firmata is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers from software on a host computer. The protocol can be implemented in firmware on any microcontroller architecture as well as software on any host computer software package. [From](https://github.com/firmata/arduino)

So if there a Firmata app running on a device, a host computrer can interact directly with the device's hardware through a standard protocol over Serial, Ethernet (Wired or WiFi) or Bluetooth. The Firmata protocol can be viewed in the first link below. There are various implementations of it for various devices:
... There is more discussion of Firmata in the Blog post. ...

> I could get the [ConfigurableFirmata](https://github.com/firmata/ConfigurableFirmata) running on a RPi Pico W over WiFi. The.NET client libraries were quite old and used a Serial connection. Using a .NET Tcpip Client, I found that the functionality I could get working with interactively was limited. So I decided to build my own "Firmata", hence Soft-ata.

## Soft-ata Projects

- Softata: The Arduino RPI Pico app
- SoftataLib: The. NET Library
- SoftataConsole: A simple .NET Console demo app
- BlazorSoftata: Blazor Web Server App, some tests as Console app.

## RPi Pico W Arduino

This requires a setup as per previous repositories here as well as in some blog posts:

- [RPI Pico W GPS Bluetooth and Azure IoT Hub](https://github.com/djaus2/RpiPicoWGPSandBT)
- [Azure IoT Hub Arduino Raspberry Pi Pico with Telemetry](https://github.com/djaus2/Azure_IoT_Hub_Arduino_RPI_Pico_Telemetry)
- [RPI-Pico-Arduino-AzSDK: Context](https://davidjones.sportronics.com.au/ardpico/RPI-Pico-Arduino-AzSDK-Context-pic-ard.html)

## Required Arduino Libraries

- [DHT11_Temperature_And_Humidity_Sensor](https://github.com/RobTillaart/Arduino/tree/master/libraries/DHTlib)
  - Direct library install from Arduino Search for **DHTlib**
- [BMx280BMI](https://bitbucket.org/christandlg/bmx280mi/src/master/)
  - Direct library install from Arduino Search for **BMx280BMI**

## Usage

See the [Console app](/SoftataConsole) but the IpAddress as determined when the Pico W runs must match that in the library. The ports must also match.
The test app has three options:
- Digital IO: Button to LED
- Analog/PWM: Potentiometer sets LED brightness.
- Serial1 and Serial2 loopback tests.

------

## Roadmap

- Azure IoT Hub connectivity
- Second core, currently flashes inbuilt LED. Add periodic read sensors and send, eg as Telemetry to that.
- _More:_ See the Blog post

Enjoy! :)

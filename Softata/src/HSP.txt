Medicare itself does not directly cover the cost of hearing aids or audiology services like hearing tests. However, there is a program called the Australian Government Hearing Services Program (HSP) that provides assistance to eligible individuals with hearing loss. Here are the key points:

Hearing Services Program (HSP):
The HSP offers subsidised high-quality hearing services and devices to eligible Australians.
It fully subsidises some hearing devices, meaning there is no cost to you, and partially subsidises others, where you pay the gap.

Types of hearing devices covered include:
Hearing Aids: Small electronic devices that improve your ability to hear by amplifying sound.
CROS Devices: Suitable for individuals with one ear having normal hearing and the other ear with hearing loss.
BiCROS Devices: Designed for people with hearing loss in both ears, where one ear might not benefit from a standard hearing aid.
Assistive Listening Devices: Used in specific situations (e.g., watching TV) or by those who canâ€™t wear traditional hearing aids.
All devices provided under the program are of high quality.
After a hearing assessment, your provider will guide you on the most suitable device.

Eligibility:
You may be eligible for the voucher scheme if you are:
An Australian citizen or permanent resident.
Aged 21 years or older.
A pensioner concession card holder, DVA Gold Card holder, or referred by a Disability Employment Service.
Vouchers are valid for 5 years from the date of issue.
Community Service Obligations (CSO) eligibility also exists for specific groups, including Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander individuals and those requiring specialist hearing services.
Incarcerated individuals may still be eligible for CSO services.
